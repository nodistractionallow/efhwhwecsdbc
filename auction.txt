what type of auction.html should looks and his functionality ?
okay nice now we proceeds to auction.html 
 Player retention has already happened (retained players are excluded from the auction).
- The remaining players are already grouped by specialty: Batters, Bowlers, All-Rounders, and Wicketkeeper-Batters or capped or not capped [ not capped players should be at last ]
- Each franchise/team must build a final squad of exact 18 players total (including retained ones)(make auction such that every team bid at last complete it's 18 players squad ).
- The user manages one team and competes against AI teams (as we know 7 AI franchises and one user franchise).
- Each team has a limited fixed budget (e.g., ₹5000L). The user as well as AI can’t overspend has to manage in such a way that spend more for very valuable player only or when they needed very few players and has more budget !.
- If the AI's budget is low, they must **wait for cheaper players** or bid wisely (no negative balance).
- The bidding system should be **challenging and strategic** — high-demand players go expensive and cause bidding wars.
- Include:
  - Player base price, demand score, and role
  - Live bidding round for each player
  - Automatic assignment of player if only one team is eligible
- The gameplay must be:
  - Smooth (no lags, clear prompts)
  - Fully Interactive (as much as possible )
  - Real-time updates: team budget, squad, players sold
- At the end, show:
  - Final squads of all teams
  - Auction summary (most expensive buys, unsold players if any)
  - Team ratings based on stats

Design the game to make it fun, hard to win, and require smart bidding from the user.
Note :- These lines are taken from my python game (auction_simulator.py  see i have uploaded that too in repository for reference only) which is very different from our game and has very poor auction mechanism but i attached it to learn a bit from it not fully i want 1000 times much better game than that which we completed 30 % already goo job for that ! but now it times for main function of game.

NOTE :- BEFORE WRITE CODE FOR THE AUCTION.HTML PLEASE ASK ME QUESTIONS WHICH YOU HAAVE ABOUT IT FOR CLARITY AND YOUR HELF THEN AFTER MY ANSWER YOU CAN PROCEEDS !
