IPL Auction 2025 Simulation Game Development Summary
Project Overview
We are developing an IPL 2025 Auction Simulation Game, a web-based application designed to replicate the strategic and financial dynamics of the Indian Premier League (IPL) player auction process. The game allows users to select a franchise, manage a ₹120Cr budget, retain up to six players with realistic fees (₹4Cr for uncapped, ₹11Cr–₹18Cr for capped), and prepare an auction pool with base prices ranging from ₹30L to ₹2Cr. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application features three core pages: retention.html for player retention, preauction.html for auction pool setup, and auction.html for bidding (under development). The system uses localStorage to persist game state, including team budgets, retained players, and custom base prices. Key functionalities include calculating retention fees based on player demand scores (100–500, derived from stats like runs, wickets, and strike rate), displaying budgets in crores, and allowing users to input custom base prices via a new component. The goal is to create an immersive, realistic experience that mirrors IPL 2025 rules, with dynamic player valuations and strategic decision-making.
Completed Work
As of now, we have completed significant portions of the project, including fully functional retention.js and preauction.js scripts, along with their corresponding HTML and CSS files. The retention page allows users to select a team, view players with details (name, specialty, capped/uncapped status), and retain players with fees calculated based on demand scores and IPL 2025 pricing (e.g., ₹18Cr for Ruturaj Gaikwad, ₹4Cr for Shashank Singh). Budget calculations are accurate, with PBKS showing ₹49.25Cr remaining after retaining five players (Shreyas Iyer at ₹26.75Cr, Yuzvendra Chahal and Arshdeep Singh at ₹18Cr each, Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh at ₹4Cr each). The pre-auction page displays retained players and an auction pool grouped by role (Batsman, Bowler, All-Rounder, Wicketkeeper-Batsman) and status (capped/uncapped), with base prices (₹30L–₹2Cr) and demand scores (e.g., Virat Kohli at ₹2Cr, demand ~400). A new basePriceInput.js component enables users to set custom base prices in the browser, defaulting to ₹50L, stored in localStorage. Error handling ensures robustness, and AI-driven retentions for non-user teams (e.g., CSK retaining Gaikwad, Dhoni, Jadeja) are implemented.
Remaining Tasks
Remaining tasks include developing the auction.html page and its JavaScript logic to handle real-time bidding, where users compete against AI teams to acquire players from the auction pool. This requires implementing a bidding system with incremental bids (e.g., ₹10L steps), updating budgets dynamically, and enforcing squad rules (minimum 18 players, maximum 25, balanced roles). Integration with the existing game state is needed to carry forward retained players and budgets. Additionally, we must enhance the UI/UX with responsive design and visual feedback (e.g., bid timers, player stats pop-ups). Testing across browsers and edge cases (e.g., budget depletion, invalid inputs) is pending to ensure stability. Finally, we need to validate the entire application against IPL 2025 auction data (e.g., 318 players, 204 slots) to ensure authenticity and refine demand score calculations for fringe players. These tasks will complete the immersive IPL auction experience you envisioned.
